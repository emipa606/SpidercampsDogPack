        [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2108362126] Animals Are Fun[/url]
        The best part about owning dogs is hanging out with them. Revolus has made a mod that lets your colonists reap the rewards of pet ownership including:
         -Playing fetch
         -Going on bff walks
         -Gaining animal handling skill the more they hang out with their 4 legged pals

        [strike][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2101205559] Animals sleep in bed[/url]
        Revolus claps back at loneliness and discomfort with this mod which lets dogs sleep in beds just like they deserve.[/strike] Not updated but can be achieved with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1966744871]Invisible Animal Beds[/url]-mod instead.

        [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441132298] Dogs Mate[/url]
        As if the first two weren't enough, Revolus hits us with a third instant classic which lets different dog breeds breed and have puppies. The liters will be half mom's breed, half dad's breed.
